# Leetcode and other problems
> This project is motivated by my quest for learning and organizing my technical work. My primary mode of learning is by solving leetcode problems. Here, I will be adding all the leetcode solution that I solve. And as part of solving what ever common DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code that I write, I'm putting that in the SimpleThinker library. Time and again I take on self driven exploration project which I will add to this repo. All the code and learnings in this repo are from my personal time

## **My Projects**
### Common Code (SimpleThinker)
* This project is pushed to [Nuget](https://nuget.org) and is available as SimpleThinker nuget package. The purpose of this project is to host all the reusable components across all the projects.

### ExploreTwitterAPI
* A twitter client project to learn and explore twitter API using the [Tweetinvi api](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TweetinviAPI/). The dev api keys of the twitter account is stored in the appsecrets.json and is encrypted using [git-secret](https://git-secret.io)

### LeedCode-LongestSubstring
* This project implements the accepted solution of the [LongestSubstring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

### LeetCode-AddTwoNumbers
* This project implements the accepted solution of the [AddTwoNumbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

### LeetCode-CircularQueue
* This project implements the learning from the queue and stacks on [CircularQueue](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/queue-stack/228/first-in-first-out-data-structure/1337/)

### LeetCode-ReverseInteger
* This project implements the accepted solution of the [ReverseInteger](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

### LeetCode-TwoSum
* This project implements the accepted solution of the [TwoSum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### Leetcode-Test
* This project has all the [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started/netcore/cmdline) test project for the leet code solution

## My development Environment (try to get the latest version)
> * Mac Mojave 
> * Visual Studio Community
> * Visual Studio Code (mainly for Markdown editing and some power editing feature, sometimes I develop my .net core project in Code and it is really fun)
> * Git/Github
